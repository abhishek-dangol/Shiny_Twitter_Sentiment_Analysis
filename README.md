Enter any twitter hashtag, word or phrase in the search bar. The app will display a sentiment graph based on the NRC sentiment analysis.


## ERRORS:
If an error is encountered, it could be due to the fact that twitter only allows a certain number of tweets to be analyzed every 15 minutes. Please wait for that time interval and try again.
